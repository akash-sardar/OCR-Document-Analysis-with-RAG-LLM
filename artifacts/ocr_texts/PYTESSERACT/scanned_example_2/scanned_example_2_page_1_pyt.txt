Missouri Public Water Systems

November 10, 2015

Dear Public Water System Owners/Operators:

The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) is in the process of implementing a new
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in its drinking water bacteriology testing
laboratory, The OpenELIS (OE) LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample management
capability, improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data entry error. In addition, the
system will provide improved reporting capabilities, including direct electronic data exchange with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ (MDNR) Safe Drinking Water Information System
(SDWIS). SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report
testing results to you and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the new OE LIMS will
provide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their own test results in real time.

As the MSPHL implements this new computer system, several changes will be made in the way you
collect and submit water samples for testing. This letter and information packet will provide you with
information to help educate you on these changes.

NEW SAMPLE BOTTLES:

Beginning in August 2015, the MSPHL began using a larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing.
This bottle has a shrink wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume. Please read the
attached “SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS” for details on how to use these new bottles,
Sample volume MUST be within the two lines on the bottle (100 — 120 mL) to be acceptable for
testing. You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones. Once you
have received the new bottles, please discard or recycle the old bottles.

NEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS:

‘The traditional sample information “card” that has been used for more than twenty years is being
replaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form. An example form is attached. Please read the
attached instructions for information on properly completing the new form.

Changes to the form include the following:

1, Form size is expanded to a single 8 72” x 11” sheet of paper. The form is no longer in a triplicate
carbon copy format. You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer. Note: MDNR
does not require a public water system to retain copies of sample collection forms; however, you
might utilize them for system inspections.

2. The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre-populated with your Public Water Supply
ID number, PWS name, address and county. Forms should not be shared with other supplies.
