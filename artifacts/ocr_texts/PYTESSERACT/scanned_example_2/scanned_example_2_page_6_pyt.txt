Bacteriological Sample Collection Procedures

Assemble all of the sampling supplies. Before you begin, wash your hands
thoroughly before handling supplies. Go to the sampling location(s) specified

in your Mi uri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) approved
} sampling site plan. The sample should be taken from a clean, smooth-nosed cold
on water faucet if possible. Avoid drinking fountains, leaky faucets, hot/cold
\ mixing faucets and frost-proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to

a) sterilize these fixtures. If possible, remove any aerators, strainers or hoses
(0) that are present because they may harbor bacteria. Follow the procedures below
when collecting the sample. Instructions for completing the environmental
sampling form are on the following page.

ies) 1. Open the cold water tap for about 3 minutes before collecting the sample.
This should adequately flush the water line of any debris.
¢ the tap and/or chemically disinfect the tap. Do not flame-
sterilize if tap is plastic or if aerators are attached. Disinfect tap by
thoroughly rinsing both the inside and outside of the tap with a mixture of 50%
house-hold bleach (NaOCl) and 50% tap water. Take extreme care with strong
bleach (oxidizing) solutions,
3. Flush the tap for an additional 3 minutes with cold water, and then reduce
to a gentle flow to about the width of a pencil. Do not change the water flow
once you have started sampling as this could dislodge contaminants in the tap.
4, Remove the plastic shrink wrap seal by pulling down on the red strip and
pealing the shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle, Discard the shrink
wrap. Do not attempt to reseal the lid with shrink wrap still attache

your hands or the outside of the bottle.
7. Fill the bottle until the water sample level is BETWEEN THE TWO
LINES on the bottle (100 — 120 ml). Preferably, the sample level should be at 7
or just slightly above the 100 ml line. Sample levels below the 100 ml (lower) Doar see
line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to insufficient sample volume. Sample
levels above the 120 ml (upper) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to
© overfilled bottle. If the bottle is overfilled, you may pour off any excess water "rseommencet
to get the sample level between the two lines. Place the cap on the bottle and
serew it down tightly.

8. Fill out the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS)

using waterproof ink. Sce attached document for instructions on properly
completing the sample collection form and for shipping instructions,

9. For single samples, neatly fold the sample collection form into thirds (standard
letter fold), roll around the bottle and place in the shipping box. For multiple
samples, fold the forms once or more as needed, and place in the shipping box
