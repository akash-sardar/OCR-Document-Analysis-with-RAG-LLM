pping Instructions

n Agency requirements, public water samples must be received by the laboratory and tested
within 30 hours of the date and time of collection. The MSPHL and MDNR recommend you use the free Department of Health
and Senior Services (DHSS) contract courier for overnight delivery to the MSPHL. This courier picks up at most local public health
agency offices and hospitals (Note: Not all hospitals will accept water samples for courier pick up). For sample drop off locations and
times, please go to http:/www.health,mo,gov/lab/courierservices.php and click on the interactive map or the listing of drop off locations
by county; or you may call the MSPHL courier liaison at (573) 751-4830, or the MDNR Public Drinking Water Branch (PDWB) at (573)
526-1124,

Please note the courier is allowed to pick up samples within one hour of the scheduled time (before or after). The earliest pick up
time is at 10:30 a.m. To ensure your samples meet the transit time requirement of 30 hours, it is important that you collect your samples in
the morning and have them dropped off at the courier pickup point one hour prior to the scheduled time.

Use of the U.S. Postal Service or other commercial carriers such as Fed Ex or UPS will require additional charges and may not meet the
30 hour transit time requirement.

Samples should not be en route to the laboratory over a weekend or state holiday (New Year’s Day, Marti
Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, ‘Truman’s Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Da
Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas.)
